orbgame
=======
Inspired by matching games like 'Puzzle and Dragons', a Bejeweled like game that does not limit movement to one colour swap. 

I found myself to really enjoy the combo aspect of Puzzle and Dragons and wanted to create a game based around it. 

TODO:

-Board initialization bug { board can initialize with matches, the application should clear this before allowing user input} 

-Orb match detection

-Refill board after wipe

-Implement gravity of orbs
